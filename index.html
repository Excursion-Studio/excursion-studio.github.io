    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This studio homepage is under construction, with studio owner Yuanxing (me) thinking of what style is suitable for this page.
    <br>
    If you have any suggestions, please contact me at <a href="mailto:conshein_yuanxing@outlook.com">conshein_yuanxing@outlook.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Outline for this page</h2>

    <p>Apart from ESPH and ESRPP, I intend to create a <u>more interactive and fashionable page</u>, i.e. <u>studio platform</u>, 
    <br>
    in order to <u>make pretty comfortable environment</u> for visitors being interested in our studio's <u>work, facilities, and products</u>.</p>
    <p>Certainly, it may take me several years to finish this project. 
    <br>
    As above points mention, I have no enough budget and professional level to build such well-equipped studio,
    <br>  
    so please let me find an employer and keep my academic route going first, because I have <u>even not obtain MSc. Degree</u> yet.</p>
    <p>But <u>building a studio is my dream, I would try my best to make it!</u>
    <br>
    In short, please <u>stay tuned</u>! During this route, I could <u>gradually fill with content</u> in this page!</p>

    The homepage of studio owner is <a href="https://chen-kaixiang-huian.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    (Of course, Yuanxing is just my alias, my real name is Kaixiang Chen.)
